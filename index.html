    <p1>Team name: Work!
<br>Team profile:
<br>Member 1: Me
<br>-	Through my last personal test results, I am said to be an introvert and most of all I have lack of communication skill. So to improve the situation, I would love to work with people who good at communicating, who are willing to help me over come my weakness.
<br>-	I have not yet had any experience on working in the IT field since it’s my very first year at RMIT. However, I’m willing to work with people who are at the same level with me because it feels comfortable working with normal people than with higher intelligent ones.
<br>Member 2: Nguyen Viet Lam Tung
<br>-	He is a friend of mine since the Pre-Advanced English class.
<br>-	Acording to his personal test results, he is also an introvert, but it’s only 61% against 39% extroverted so he is still fits in the spot. Besides, team up with a well-known friend is the best way for me to work around as a team.
<br>-	His experience is the same with me, although he helped me little on the last project but I trust him better than anyone else (who knows if others don’t contribute anything at all).
<br>Member 3 and 4: People I want to work with.
<br>-	Have great communication skills. This might somehow help me to balance my introverted and extroverted sides, since the test result was 100% introverted.
<br>-	Willing to take on tasks that they are good at or even the ones that they aren’t, we can figure it out together.
<br>-	About experience, no requirement needed, anyone is welcome.</p1>

  <h3 style="font-size:150%">3. Project ideas:</h3>
  <p3 style="font-weight:bolder">Application name: RecipeBook.</p3>
  <p4>-	Overview: RecipeBook will be a mobile phone application or a website, which users can create their own accounts then post their cooking recipes on the account’s walls.
Morever, users can like or dislike, save recipe and follow other users to get their latests cooking recipes.
<br>-	Motivation: The project will be problably useful for people who like to cook new dishes around the world. Like my mom, she sometimes looks up for some new cooking recipes on some random websites, but she always asks me how to save or share them to our neighbors and relatives. So I came up with this project, RecipeBook is meant to be easy to use for everyone, for all ages. It helps people to save recipes they fancy trying to cook or easily post their own recipes easily with some extra app’s functions.
<br>-	Description: Account: every user has to make an account in order to post, save or like the posted recipes. However, everyone can still see posted recipes without log-in. The sign-up and log-in procedure will only ask for emails and passwords, this app is not a market or a trading place so no credit card will be allowed to enter.
Profile: the account profile will include some features such as “cooking styles”, “cooking level”. These features will help other users to look for recipes that fits themselves the most.
<br>Posting:  After logging into an account, user can post their cooking recipes. The posting procedure will include some features like “Name”, “Ingredients” (Users can add many ingredients they want), “Units”, “Steps” (The more steps the easier) and “More details” (tips, how hard to cook this recipe, any possible problem?). Morever, each of the features can be added with pictures or videos depend on what users want to share.
<br>Interaction between users: Users can follow others if they think that user posted some really good recipes so when that followed user post another, notification will come up. Save recipe is the most important feature, users can save any recipe they want to try then open it later. However, if the posted recipe is deleted, saved recipe will also be deleted. Moreoever, there is like and dislike function, this helps users to determine whether that recipe is good or not. Users can also report inappropriate posts, by doing this the reported posts will be sent to the censorship and hided on the wall.
<br>Policy and report: If any post is reported as inappropriated, there should be a team who look at these and decide to delete or keep the post. Posts must be about food, and the food must not represent sexual content or related to politics.
The differences between RecipeBook and other social media platforms: There is no inbox or comment function, so users can chat or leave any comment on other users’s posts.
<br>-	Tools and Technologies: The website will need a database to store all of the user’s information and posts. So I think MySQL or any database infrastruture will be needed. The website and the application can be programmed by any language that is appropriated, or maybe like Facebook, which is created by using PHP programming language.
<br>- Skill Required:
<br>+ Coding: PHP or C++ to program the software.
<br>+ Know how to work with MySQL or any other database.
<br>+ Understand the concept and know what experience the project wants to bring to users.
<br>-	Outcome: If the project is succesful, everyone who has passion about cooking will have a lovely application to explore new recipes everyday or have a place to share their own ideas. The bad side is that my mom will never need me to help with the IT problem while looking for cooking recipes. Also many jobs will be provided.</p4>
  <h4 style="font-size:150%">4. Feedback: 4 people</h4>
  <p5>“Great idea, it helps people who love cooking like me to to improve cooking skill” (2 said)
<br>“Learn more new recipes!” (2 said)
<br>Critism:
<br>“Has many similarities with Facebook and Instagram” (all 4 said).
<br>“What if suggested posts on the walls are all hard recipes?” (1 suggested)
<br>“What if users post stupid cooking recipes like Instant noodle or something impossible to make?” (2 suggested)
<br>To me all feedbacks are useful feedbacks. First of all, many people said that RecipeBook is just another social media like Facebook and Instagram, I actually see that too, in fact, I came up with the idea while surfing Facebook and saw too many posts about food. To fix that, the user-interface can look as different as possible from other social medias to get its uniqueness. About the suggested posts on the wall, it’s true that the app should not show too many posts that requiring inappropriate cooking skills because that can make users feel more likely to quit. The solution is that all the suggested posts will be based on the “cooking skill” that is set by users on their profiles and the posts they liked or saved. About the stupid recipe, thanks to this suggestion, I came up with the new function, “ignore” will let users hide everything related to that ignored user.
<br>Outcomes: suggested user-interface, suggested posts base on user’s activity and cooking skill, ignore function.</p5>
  <h5 style="font-size:150%">5. IT Technologies:</h5>
  <p6>- Cloud Computing
<br>This technology is said to be currently at its infancy [1]. However, its benefit has already been a big deal to the IT world, it deliveries servers, database, intelligence, software and much more through the internet. Its potential is endless, my prediction for the future is this technology will become cheaper as it is still expensive right now, its performance will be faster, reducing network latency, giving companies a lot of flexibility.
<br>Computing used to be all about boxes containing metal and silicon, every single IT workplace always contained those boxes, they consumed much electricity, regularly required updates and they even crashed sometimes [2]. Then cloud computing arrived made a huge impact on every business, it changed everything, all the data are now “floating” and stored remotely, reducing costs of electrical bill and regular system updates, all they need to do is paying monthly subcription.
<br>As for me, besides the video games data, my study works are currently not so much that require a lot of storage space. However, maybe 1 or 2 years from now, I will have to store everything on the cloud.
<br>-	Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning:
<br>When talking about the state of the art of AI then it must be about it’s Deep Learning. It is the models that work with non-texual data like image or voice recognition. Those features allow AI the feature that recognize objects, give it the ability to assist in many different fields. Such as in biology, AI helps biologists determine the order of DNA, distinguish proteins and their biological roles [3]. Morever, Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, the model that focuses on setting AI up the ability to perform works without human interaction. Machine Learning’s goal is to make a computer that can make decisions and predictions even without being programmed. In medicine, the model helps making decions about treatments, medications and what patients need [4].
<br>The potential is endless. In the future, these technologies will make doctos able to diagnosing or detect tumors more accurate, or there will be an application that allows users to self-manage their health like diagnose cancers everytime, everywhere. Beside the medical field, AI will make the biggest impact on the transportation by being self-driving cars or in entertainment field with a better version of Siri that can reponse to almost every requests and not just say “Sorry, I didn’t quite get that”.
<br>As for me, I would love to have a fully functional entertaining AI at home. Then I will have someone to talk to or even falling in love like the movie “Her (2021)”. Moreover, having an application that can diagnose health condition everywhere will problably very useful for everyone, especially old people.</p6>

<br>There are many different fields so answers will split into different people.
<br>1.	What kind of work is done by IT professional?
<br>-	Jason Weimann (Game developer): everyday he takes the latest version of the code that his team is working on, then just continue coding and commiting as he goes along. Sometimes he works with big team and sometimes in a very tiny team that works on “writing quest text”.
<br>-	Zach (Information Systems Technician at a hostpital): he does everything, everyday is completely different like checking tickets (what needs to be done, whats on high priority), answering phones constantly, creating and managing user/email accounts.
<br>-	M (Infrastructure engineer in Security): writing and fixing report, coding for the services and helping with quick server issue. Participate and provide solutions, ideas in meetings.
<br>2.	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
<br>-	Jason Weimann (Game developer): works with other developers in his team, sometimes he got transfer to different teams. Talks to designers, discuss about models and how to make them work.
<br>-	Zach ((Information Systems Technician at a hostpital): deals with costumers through the phone, discusses with his co-worker and his wife who also works there as an IT.
<br>-	M (Infrastructure engineer in Security): works with his co-worker, other IT professionals. He also participates in meeting with others and his boss.
<br>3.	Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?
<br>-	Jason Weimann (Game developer): it’s not like just sitting there playing video games, people just sometimes play games when there are new big games came out and discuss about it. So he spends most of this time at work programming.
<br>-	Zach (Information Systems Technician at a hostpital): spends most of the time at work answering phones
<br>-	M (Infrastructure engineer in Security): after meetings, he spends most of the work time at home, specifically at night, writing reports and coding.
<br>4.	What aspect of their position is most challenging?
<br>-	Jason Weimann (Game developer): works on the game releasing weeks with crazy amount of hours, like almost 60 hours a week.
<br>-	Zach (Information Systems Technician at a hostpital): when there’s new technology update like Window 10 and he still works on Window XP and 7 sytem. It’s hard to get everything compatible with that new update.</p7>
