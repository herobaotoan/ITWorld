<br>Team profile:
<br>Member 1: Me
<br>-	Through my last personal test results, I am said to be an introvert and most of all I have lack of communication skill. So to improve the situation, I would love to work with people who good at communicating, who are willing to help me over come my weakness.
<br>-	I have not yet had any experience on working in the IT field since it’s my very first year at RMIT. However, I’m willing to work with people who are at the same level with me because it feels comfortable working with normal people than with higher intelligent ones.
<br>Member 2: Nguyen Viet Lam Tung
<br>-	He is a friend of mine since the Pre-Advanced English class.
<br>-	Acording to his personal test results, he is also an introvert, but it’s only 61% against 39% extroverted so he is still fits in the spot. Besides, team up with a well-known friend is the best way for me to work around as a team.
<br>-	His experience is the same with me, although he helped me little on the last project but I trust him better than anyone else (who knows if others don’t contribute anything at all).
<br>Member 3 and 4: People I want to work with.
<br>-	Have great communication skills. This might somehow help me to balance my introverted and extroverted sides, since the test result was 100% introverted.
<br>-	Willing to take on tasks that they are good at or even the ones that they aren’t, we can figure it out together.
<br>-	About experience, no requirement needed, anyone is welcome.</p>
